    "# Dask Loading and Saving to Zarr\n",
    "Here we will quickly show an option to open a folder of tif files as a dask stack. Afterwards we can save it to a zarr file which makes handling of the data much easier. To load the folder we are using a custom function `make_dask_stack_from_folder`: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def make_dask_stack_from_folder(folder: str, prefix: str):\n",
    "    filenames = sorted(glob(folder + prefix + \"*.tif\"), key=alphanumeric_key)\n",
    "    # read the first file to get the shape and dtype\n",
    "    # ASSUMES THAT ALL FILES SHARE THE SAME SHAPE/TYPE\n",
    "    sample = imread(filenames[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "    lazy_imread = delayed(imread)  # lazy reader\n",

For general information on zarr you can read the [documentation](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) but we will go through a few of the parameters of the [`to_zarr`](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.array.to_zarr.html) function now. \n",
